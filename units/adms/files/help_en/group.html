  <h2>Role Management</h2>
  <br />
    During daily use, the super user needs to assign new  users having different levels. To avoid individual setting for each user, roles  having certain levels can be set in role management, and then be assigned to  specified users, including the levels set for five major functional modules of  personnel, device, access control, attendance and system setting. The system’s  default super user has all levels, and can create new users and set  corresponding levels as required.<br /><br />
  <b>Role setting steps:</b><br /><br />
    (1) Click [Add] to enter role setting interface;
  <div class="alignC"></div>

    <br />
	(3) After setting, click [OK] to save and return to the  list, and added role settings will be shown in the list.<br /><br />
