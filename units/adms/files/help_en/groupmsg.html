  <h2>System reminder setting</h2><br />

  Set the person and time that the system reminds. System  reminders include reminders of probation end, birthday, contract expiration, ID  card expiration and personnel transfer success. After setting a system  reminder, when the noticed person opens the system during the system reminder  time, a dialog box will pop up on the lower right corner to remind the person.<br /><br />

      <b>Add system reminder setting:</b><br /><br />

    System reminders are used to assign a notice to  different roles for view.<br />
    Click [Add] to show the edit interface, select type  (system, attendance, access control, personnel). Select which roles (system  parameter, personnel, device, access control, attendance, and system) the  levels will be assigned to, click [OK] to complete adding and return, and the  added system reminder will appear in the list.<br />
