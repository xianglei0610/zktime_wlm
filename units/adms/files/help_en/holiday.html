  The attendance time on a holiday may differ from that  on a weekday. For easy operation, the system has provided holiday setting to  set attendance time and attendance rules for holidays. After setting, the date  will automatically become the work type of the holiday. This day worked by  someone will be counted as overtime on holiday.<br /><br />
