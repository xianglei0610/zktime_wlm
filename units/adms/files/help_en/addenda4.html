    A: In the following cases, overtime will appear in an  employee’s attendance results: 1. During the attendance timetable, if the  working duration is 0, then this duration will be calculated as overtime in the  statistical results; 2. During the attendance timetable, if “Whether delay  calculated as overtime” is checked, then the overtime worked by the employee  will be automatically calculated as overtime. If “The timetable contains fixed  overtime (minute)” is set as a number other than 0, then the overtime will be  based on the value in the attendance result. If it is set as 0, then the  overtime will be based on the actual overtime worked; 3. When adding temporary  scheduling, if “Specify work type” as overtime, then the temporary scheduling  will be calculated as overtime in the attendance result; 4. Set in attendance  parameters by checking “Check-out () minutes after work calculated as overtime”  (This settings must conform to the setting in 2); 5.

  <b>Q: What are the relations  between permitted late/ early leave, late/ early leave, and absence?</b><br />
    A: During the attendance timetable, permitted late/ early  leave time means late/ early leave during the interval will be neglected. When  exceeding this interval, late/ early leave duration will be calculated in the  attendance result. Or, if “late/ early leave for N minutes” is selected for the  “Work without check-in/ check-out entry is recorded as” setting, then late/ early  leave duration will be calculated as per such setting. If the “Late/ early  leave for over N minutes recorded as absence” duration is exceeded, the  attendance will be calculated as absence. Or if “absence” is selected for the  “Work without check-in/ check-out entry is recorded as” setting, then the  attendance will be calculated as absence.<br /><br />
  <b>Q: Do user attendance in  different areas differ?</b><br />
    A: One user can only belong to one area for  corresponding daily attendance check. Attendance parameters are the same in  different areas. If a user travels to another area on business, just change his  attendance area in area user management in the system, without affecting his  daily attendance.<br /><br />
  <b>Q: What are the relations  between timetable duration, attendance duration, working minutes, working  duration and overtime duration?</b><br />
    A: 1. Timetable duration refers to the working duration  of an attendance timetable in the shift setting of the day. 2. Attendance  duration refers to the duration between actual check-in and actual check-out.  3. Working minutes refer to working duration based on actual check-in, actual  check-out, mandatory check-in and mandatory check-out. 4. Working duration: The  duration worked between check-in and check-out time set in the attendance  timetable, in minutes. The value entered may not be equal to the timetable  duration, being greater or less, depending on corporate rules. The value, if  being 0, represents overtime duration, and will not be counted as working  duration. 5. Overtime duration: overtime duration is calculated in two ways.  One is based on the overtime actually worked. The other is based on fixed  overtime.<br /><br />
  <b>Q: Why corrected status needs  to be set in attendance result?</b><br />
    A: The system’s default attendance statuses include  check-in before work, check-out after work, dining start, dining end, absence,  return from absence, overtime check-in, and overtime check-out, but the final  attendance report may only require the statistics of check-in before work and  check-out, therefore, other attendance statuses will, as per punch time, be  automatically corrected to corresponding statuses. For example, if an  employee’s schedule is 8:00-18:00, and the punch time 10:00, with the punch  status being dining start, then the system will automatically correct it as  check-in before work.<br /></div><br />
