  <h2>Door Settings</h2>
  <br />
  Currently the system supports the connection and  control of up to 50 access control panels.<br />
    The access control system is primarily for the  management of personnel forbidden and admission. For security, a company will  set personnel admission time zones, forbidden time zones and combinations of  time zones. For door opening verification, First-Card Normal Open, Multi-Card  Opening, anti-passback, linkage, and interlock can be set to enhance security.  This system can provide real-time monitoring of doors and output of exception,  access control events and access level reports.<br />

  <br />
  <h3> Door Management</h3>
  <br />
  Click [Access control] - [Door configuration], and by  default it will access [Door management] interface, showing the list of all  control panels. When unfolded, it can show all doors under the control of the  control panel. Upon first entry into the access interface or successful query,  if currently the system has access control panels or the query result is not  null, by default it will unfold the doors of the first access control panel.  Click corresponding button for relevant parameter setting.<br />
      <br />
    Door management operations include: control panel  management and door management.<br /><br />
  <b>1. Control panel operation</b><br />
   <br />
    For communication between the system and the device,  data uploading, configuration downloading, device and system parameters shall  be set. The user can see access control panels within his levels in the current  system, and can edit the devices here. If the user needs to add or delete  devices, operate in device management.<br /><br />
    Control panel management includes: Modify IP address, Close auxiliary output, disable, Enable, Modify communication password, Synchronize time, Upload event record, Upgrade firmware, and Get event entries.<br /><br />

  <b>2. Door Management:</b><br />
  <br />
    The device list will show all access control devices.  Click the “+” button before the device name to show the door list under a  device. When adding device, it will automatically add doors (corresponding  device name and door numbers can not be edited) according to the number of  doors. Before using the device (including doors), the user must edit door  information one by one (or apply current settings to other doors). After  editing, they will be sent to the device, which can be used after successful setting.<br /><br />
  <b>(1) Door parameter  modification:</b><br /><br />
    Select the door to be modified, and click [Edit] under  “Related operation” to show the Edit interface;<br />
    <br />
  <b>The fields are as follows:</b><br /><br />
  <b>Device name: </b>It is not editable (need to be edited in 6.2.1   Access control device);<br /><br />
  <b>Door number: </b>The system automatically name the numbers of  doors according to how many doors of the device (for example, the four doors of  a four-door control panel are numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4). The number will be  consistent with the door number on the device.<br />
  <br /><b>Note: </b>Although by default the  number following the underline in the door name is consistent with the door  number, but 1/2/3/4   in anti-passback and interlock refers to door serial number  rather than the number following the door name, and they have no necessary relation,  and the system allows the user to modify the door name, so they can not be  confused;<br /><br />
  <b>Door name:</b> The default door name is “device name_door  number”. The field allows the user to modify as required. Up to 30 characters  can be entered;<br /><br />
  <b>Door valid time zone</b>, <b>door  normal open time zone</b>: By default either is null. Initialized and added  access control time zones will be shown for the user to select. Upon door  editing, door valid time zone is need to input. Only after setting door valid time  zone, the door can be opened and closely normally. We recommend to set door  normal open time period within the door valid time zone, only in this situation,  the door normal open time zone is valid;<br />
  <br /><b>Note: </b>Consecutive punching of a  card having access level of the door for 5 times can release the normal open  status within one day (including First-Card Normal Open), and close the door  immediately.<br /><br />
  <b>Lock open duration:</b> Used to control the delay for unlocking  after card punching. The unit is second, and the default is 5 seconds. The user  can enter a number between 0-254;<br /><br />
  <b>Punch interval: </b>The unit is second (range: 0-10 seconds),  and the default is 2 seconds;<br /><br />
  <b>Door sensor type: </b>NO (door sensor not detected), Normal Open,  Normal Close. The default is NO. When editing doors, the user can select the  door sensor type to be Normal Open or Normal Close. If Normal Open or Normal  Close is selected, it is required to select <b>door status delay</b> and whether<b> close and reverse-lock </b>is required. By default, once door sensor type is  set as Normal Open or Normal Close, the default door status delay will be 15s,  and by default it will enable close and reverse-lock.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Door status delay:</b> The duration for delayed detection of door  sensor after the door is opened. Detection is performed only after the door is  opened and the delay duration expired. When the door is not in the “Normally  Open” period, and the door is opened, the device will start timing. It will  trigger alarm when the delay duration expired, and stop alarm when you close  the door. The default door status delay will be 15s. The<b> door status delay </b>should be longer than<b> lock open duration</b>.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Close and reverse-lock: </b>Set locking or not after door closing. Tick  it for lock after door closing.<br />
  <br />
