  <h2>Device Management</h2>
  <br />

  Set the communication parameters of connected devices.  Only when communication parameters, including system settings and device  settings, are correct, normal communication with devices will be possible. When  communication is successful, you can view the information of connected devices,  and perform remote monitoring, uploading and downloading data.<br />
  <div class="zkeco">The system supports access control and attendance  system, so connecting devices includes add access control panel and add  attendance recorder. To add access control panel, search and view devices  connected to the network, and directly add from the searching result. For an  attendance device having ADMS function, just set in the device and then connect  to the network.  </div>

  <br />
  <b>IP port No.:</b> In Ethernet mode, the default is 4370;</div>
  <br />
<div class="zkecoacc"><b>RS485:</b><br /></div>

  <div class="alignC zkeco"><img width="807" height="21" src="device_clip_image006.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="alignC zkecoacc"></div>
  <br />
  <div class="zkecoacc">
  <b>Serial port number:</b> COM1-COM254;<br />
  <br />
  <b>RS485 address: </b>The machine number. When serial port numbers  are the same, there will be no repeated 485 addresses;<br />
  <br />
  <b>Baud rate: </b>Same as the baud rate of the device (9600/  19200/ 38400/ 57600/115200). The default is 38400;<br />
  <br />
  <b>Device name: </b>Any character, up to a combination of 20  characters;<br />
  <br />
  <b>Communication password: </b> Any character, up to a combination of 15 characters (No blank). You need to input this field only when you add a new device with the communication password. It can’t be modify when you edit the device information except in [Modify communication password] operation.  Please refer  to <U> <a href="accdoor.html">Door Management</a></U>. <br />
  <br /><b> </b><b>Note: </b>You need not input this  field if the device has no communication password, such as it is new factory  device or just after the initialization.<br /><br />

  <b>Panel type: </b>One-door panel, two-door panel, four-door  panel;<br />
  <br />
  <b>Switch to two-door two-way: </b>When four-door panel is selected, this box  will appear. By default, it is not ticked. The parameter is used to switch the  four-door one-way access control panel to two-door two-way access control panel  (For changes of extended device parameters before and after switching, see  relevant files of access control panel).<br />
  <br /><b> </b><b>Note: </b>After the four door one-way  access control panel is switched to two- door two-way access control panel, to  switch back, you need delete the device from the system and add it again. When  adding, do not tick the check box before this parameter.<br /><br />

  <b>Auto synchronize device time:</b> By default it is ticked, namely, it will  synchronize device time with server time each time connecting the device. If it  is unchecked, the user can manually synchronize device time;<br />
  <br />
<b>Area: </b>Specify areas of devices. After area setting,  devices (doors) can be filtered by area upon real-time monitoring.<br />
    <br />
	<span class="zkeco">(3)</span><span class="acc">(2)</span> After editing, click [OK], and the system will try  connecting the current device:<br />
    <br />
	If connection is successful, it will read corresponding  extended parameters of the device. At this time, if the access control panel  type selected by the user does not meet the corresponding parameters of the  actual device, the system remind the user. If the user clicks [OK]to save, it  will save the actual access control panel type of the device;<br />
    <br />
	Extended device parameters: Serial number, device type,  firmware version number, auxiliary input quantity, auxiliary output quantity,  door quantity, and reader quantity.<br />
    <br />
	If device connection fails, while the user still needs  to add the device to the system, corresponding device parameters and extended  parameters, such as serial number, will not be written into the system, and  such settings as anti-passback and linkage will be impossible. These settings  can be created only when the device is reconnected successfully and  corresponding parameters are acquired.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Note: </b>When you add a new device to the system, the software will clear all user information, timezones, holidays, and access control levels settings (includes access control group, anti-pass back, interlock settings, linkage settings, etc.) from the device, except the events record in the device. Unless the information in the device is unusable, we recommend you not to delete the device in used, to avoid the lost of information.
