<h2>Exception type management</h2><br />
    In special cases, personnel may need to ask for leave  for different reasons, and hope exceptions to be shown upon system statistics.  In the exception inputting module, it is required to select exception type. By  default the system has set 5 exception types, and by default existing exception  types can not be deleted or modified. If the types are insufficient, you can  add. Added types can be modified or deleted.<br /><br />
    The system’s default exception types include sick  leave, personal leave, maternity leave, home leave and annual leave.<br /><br />
