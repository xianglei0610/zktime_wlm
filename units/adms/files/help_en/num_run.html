Flexible shifts are suitable for entrepreneurs, business personnel,  service personnel and order-based production personnel, etc.<br />
    For example, if a personnel have flexible work time but  need to record the attendance, then flexible shift can be use by default. In  attendance statistics, it will show the check-in, check-out time, and count the  overtime by even card punches.<br /><br />
